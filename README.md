# REACT JS

A library is a collection of prewritten code snippets that developers can use and reuse to perform various JavaScript functions. The purpose of a library is to equip developers with prewritten structures of code with specified functions to make coding faster, more efficient, and less repetitive for the developers. React is one such library. React is an open-source JavaScript library created by Facebook in 2011 designed to help developers build the front-end of a website, or the user interface (UI). React is currently the most popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It is important to remember that React is only a library and not a framework like Angular or Vue, as React is not an all-in-one development solution.

### Key Features 

#### *1. JSX (JavaScript Syntax Extension):*
While HTML structures web pages, JavaScript brings interactivity through programming logic and functions. JSX takes the relationship between these technologies a step further by allowing JavaScript code to seamlessly integrate within HTML tags. Rather than separating JavaScript code from the HTML layout it controls, JSX lets JavaScript objects nest directly inside elements. Though browsers are unaware of JSX, the Babel transpiler translates it to standard JavaScript that browsers can interpret. This merging of HTML markup and JavaScript code produces highly readable and maintainable component-based applications. For those with experience in both front-end languages, adopting JSX presents a shallow learning curve. Its straightforward syntax simplifies the process of dynamically generating UI components from JavaScript objects and functions.

#### *2. Virtual DOM:*
DOM, Document Object Model, serves as the architectural foundation for dynamic web pages. Traditionally, JavaScript frameworks directly update the actual DOM whenever any changes occurs, slowing the rendering of updates. In contrast, React employs a virtual DOM - a purely in-memory representation mirroring the real DOM. On each re-render, the virtual DOM efficiently reconciles by calculating the precise changes required and only applying the necessary updates to the real DOM. This separation optimizes performance by avoiding costly full redraws and instead incrementally pushing incremental changes, improving perceived responsiveness for the end user, hence the name React, as it is reacting to the state changes.

#### *3. One-way Data Binding:*
As the name implies, one-way data binding flows solely downstream or one-way. Under React, information can only transfer from parent component to child component in a unidirectional fashion. While child components return data to the parent, they can communicate to the parent to initiate state changes in response to various inputs. 

#### *4. Performance:*
Because React uses virtual DOM and only updates the updated portions, the DOM operates faster and more efficient. 

#### *5. Extension:*
With the help of React's numerous extensions, we can build whole user interface applications. Both server-side rendering and mobile app development are supported. To assist us design visually appealing user interfaces, React has been expanded with Flux, Redux, React Native, and other tools.

#### *6. Conditional Statements:*
It is possible to write conditional statements using JSX. The data in the browser is based on the conditions specified inside the JSX.

#### *7. Components:*
Because React.js is component-based, it separates the page into several parts. Every component has its own logic and design and is a part of the UI design. As a result, the JavaScript-written component logic makes things simple, quick, and reusable.

#### *8. Simplicity:*
React.js employs JSX, a blend of HTML and JavaScript, and is component-based, making the code reusable. This reduces the amount of code and makes it easier to comprehend and troubleshoot.
